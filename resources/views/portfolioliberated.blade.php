   				<p>Liberated Living was an earlier attempt for me using WordPress. It was a little bit of a learning experience for myself to gain an understanding of the workings and different features Wordpress was capable of.  The premade content management system was definitely a feature that attracted me to using it.  There are a few things I would do a bit differently in the future to clean up the code a little but that will come if there is a next iteration of the site.</p>

   				<p>The site design was created from the ground up.  Some technologies used in the creation are JavaScript, MySQL,  and Photoshop/Illustrator.  I did write combination of my own custom applications such as the recipe database tool/viewer and modified an existing word press event plug-in to feature new upcoming events.
